Serial Jobs:
Works with non-graphics serial python, albeit inconsistently
Does not work with matplotlib (graphics/X. That may need additional configging)

parallel Jobs:
Works with python multiprocessing pool, albeit with many error messages, and one checkpoint file per process.
Expected not to work with mpi4py until the mpicc compatibility with dmtcp is resolved
Not tested graphics applications
